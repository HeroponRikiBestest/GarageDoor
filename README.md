## How to contribute
#### Texts
- **Clone** the repo
- Download the last .zip file from releases
- Copy and paste everything into your Garage game root folder (replace files if needed)
- Run `LaunchGame.bat`
- Play the game and when you find an untraslated text the program will dump it and add it to the file `translation.ini`
- Edit the file `translation.ini` (no need to restart or close the game) and translate the new text (default value `NOT_TRANSLATED_TEXT`)
- Be sure not to break the .ini file removing `=` symbol, `[Phrases] `and `[Settings]`
- If you want you can submit a pull request so I can merge your translations with the main ones

#### Textures (unstable)
Remember that this is experimental and may lead to crashes.
- Use [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/ "gimp") to open my blank templates in `dir_data/assets`
- Edit them with your better translations
- Export them to `.bmp `
- **Open them with** [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html "paint.net") and **save them back again** with 8-bit setting (fixes game crash probably due unsupported bmp)

#### Intro
- Intro texts are images stored in `dir_data\open.swf` file
- You have to edit it file using an extractor like "Flash Decompiler Trillix"
